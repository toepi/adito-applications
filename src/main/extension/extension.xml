		This extension adds the 'Applications' feature to Adito.
		By itself, this extension does not do much, you must download
		the 'Application Extension' for the application you wish to use.
		3SP Provide a number of pre-built extensions (e.g. RDP Client,
		VNC Viewer, Terminal Emulator etc) from the 3SP Extension Store.
		Alternatively you may create your own extension. See
		documentation for more information on how to do this. Once you
		have an installed Application Extension, you may then create
		'Application Shortcuts'. Application Shortcuts are used to
		configure and launch instances of any installed and supported
		Application.
